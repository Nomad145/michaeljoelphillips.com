I bought this domain a few years ago thinking that I might put it to good use
as a blog someday.  After several failed ideas on how to get started, and
accidentally letting this domain expire once, I'm finally writing my first blog
post.

I'm a Software Developer inspired by the likes of
[Ocramius](https://ocramius.github.io/), [Anthony
Ferrara](https://blog.ircmaxell.com/), [DHH](https://m.signalvnoise.com/@dhh),
and countless others in the Open Source community to blog about some of the
things I'm most passionate about.  I plan to use this space to write on
Programming, Vim, and Programming related things; especially related to PHP and
Object Oriented Programming and Design.
